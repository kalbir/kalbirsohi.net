I've started to keep a small note of things I've read over the past few months and I thought it might be interesting to publish it here as the format I use (a really long note in [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/)) can get a little unwieldy.

So here are some things I read in January and February. I'll mainly keep it to books and longer bits of writing (that I've enjoyed in the latter case). I'm a subscriber to the New Yorker magazine so that will turn up quite a lot (and I was going through quite a big backlog in Feb!).

## January 2019

### Books

- _Play it again_ by Alan Rusbridger &mdash; good read, lots of interesting musing on the theme of learning later in life. Found the Guardian stuff a little less interesting. Too much name dropping and self importance at times.
- _There are more beautiful things than Beyoncé_ by Morgan Parker &mdash; some absolute cracking poems in here, but uneven.
- _asymmetry_ by Lisa Halliday &mdash; deeply frustrating. Pretty well written novel, albeit forced in places but the whole _schtick_ around the "surprise" at the end and the "groundbreaking" modernist structure left me absolutely baffled and feeling stupid. 
- _The little virtues_ by Natalia Ginzburg &mdash; brilliant, thoughtful, lots of messages that I am quoting in life all the time. A keeper. _My vocation_ and _The little virtues_ are essays for the ages. 

### Articles

- [Why Doctors Hate Their Computers][ny8] by Atul Gawande

## February 2019

### Books

- _The amazing adventures of Kavalier and Clay_ by Michael Chabon &mdash; I think that if I'd read this when I was 18 it would be one of my favourite novels. These days I like my emotions a little more intimate. But a lot of fun and some really moving parts amongst the grandiose. Lots of great new words in there too.

### Articles

- [The family business that put Nashville hot chicken on the map][ny1] by Paige Williams &mdash; this and the "French Burglar" article below remind me why I subscribe to the _New Yorker_, utterly original writing that gives you a view of people you will never meet.
- [The Secrets of Lyndon Johnson’s Archives][ny2] by Robert Caro &mdash; Robert Caro is one of my top two or three writers. His commitment to his LBJ project is unprecedented. He's also a great storyteller. 
- [The French Burglar Who Pulled Off His Generation’s Biggest Art Heist][ny3] by Jake Halpern
- [The Philosopher Redefining Equality][ny4] by Nathan Heller
- [China’s Bizarre Program to Keep Activists in Check][ny5] by Jianying Zha
- [Julia Louis-Dreyfus Acts Out][ny6] by Ariel Levy
- _Everything_ in the [Dec, 3 issue][ny7] that republished archive stories about New York, but particularly James Baldwin, Nancy Franklin and Dawn Powell.
