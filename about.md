Kalbir Sohi is the CEO of [drie](https://drie.co), a company that helps people use cloud infrastructure securely.

In the past, Kalbir did a PhD in Philosophy, was a product manager for government and built a [cloud platform](https://hmrcdigital.blog.gov.uk/2015/07/30/laying-the-foundations-for-hmrcs-digital-services/) that you probably use when you pay your taxes. He's worked with startups, large companies and governments in three continents helping them move to the cloud.

He likes reading, _a lot_.
