Hi, I'm Kalbir Sohi and I lead teams that do useful and interesting things with technology.

In the past, I was the CEO of [drie](https://drie.co), a company that helps people use cloud infrastructure securely. I also did a PhD in Philosophy, was a product manager, tech lead and strategy consultant in government and built a [cloud platform](https://hmrcdigital.blog.gov.uk/2015/07/30/laying-the-foundations-for-hmrcs-digital-services/) that UK readers probably use when paying their taxes. I've worked with startups, large companies and governments in three continents helping them with [digital](https://definitionofdigital.com/) things.

I like reading, _a lot_ and play tennis whenever I can.
